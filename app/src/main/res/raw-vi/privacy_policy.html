<h3>INFORMATION TWINLIFE HAS</h3>
<p><strong><em>twinme</em></strong> end-to-end encrypted peer-to-peer messaging and voice/video calling
    services provides "<em>Privacy by Design</em>" in accordance with the European General Data Protection
    Regulation (EU GDPR). Twinlife as the operator of <strong><em>twinme</em></strong> servers has no
    way to decrypt messages or calls between <strong><em>twinme</em></strong> users because (1) exchanges
    happen in peer-to-peer directly between devices, with no staging server storing content, and (2)
    Twinlife does not have knowledge of the private keys used to encrypt data.</p>

<h3>INFORMATION TWINLIFE HAS</h3>
<h4>1. Information stored by <strong>twinme</strong> servers</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>The unique identifier randomly generated when <strong><em>twinme</em></strong> was activated
        on your mobile device for the first time, which is used as an account identifier.</li>
 	<li>Profiles' information (e.g., avatars and nicknames) you and your <strong><em>twinme</em></strong>
        contacts use to refer to one another.</li>
 	<li>Randomly generated tokens (i.e., twincodes), used for setting up a call or transmitting a message
        between a particular pair of contacts.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Transient information</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Certain information (e.g., twincodes and their IP address at this particular time) is transmitted
        to <strong><em>twinme</em></strong> signaling servers solely for the purpose of placing calls or
        transmitting messages. Unless otherwise stated below, such information is only kept as long as necessary
        to place each call or transmit each message, and is not used for any other purpose.</li>
 	<li>Log information used for statistical purposes on the general use of the <strong><em>twinme</em></strong>
        service during given periods of times (e.g., number of users, device brands and operating systems,
        locations, number and duration of calls, number of messages exchanged, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Information accessed on your device</h4>
<ul>
 	<li><strong><em>twinme</em></strong> does not access any personal information from your device such
        as your phone number or address book.</li>
 	<li><strong><em>twinme</em></strong> asks your permission to access
<ul>
 	<li>your camera to be able to take photos used as avatars in your profiles;</li>
 	<li>your photo album if you want to use pictures as avatars in your profiles, or send them as
        messages to your contacts;</li>
 	<li>to your secondary memory (SD-Card) if you have one, to access its contents you want to use or
        exchange with <strong><em>twinme</em></strong>;</li>
 	<li>your camera and microphone to make voice or video calls;</li>
 	<li>your networks and systems tools to communicate and notify you of incoming calls and messages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>None of the information accessed by <strong><em>twinme</em></strong> on your device is sent
        to the <strong><em>twinme</em></strong> servers except as mentioned in the previous two sections.</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Information stored on your device</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Profiles' information (e.g., avatars and nicknames) you and your <strong><em>twinme</em></strong>
        contacts use to refer to one another.</li>
 	<li>Contents of messages exchanged in conversations with your contacts, until the conversation has
        been reset. Once reset, all messages sent and received in a conversation are erased on both devices:
        yours and your contactâ€™s device.</li>
</ul>

<h3>INFORMATION TWINLIFE MAY SHARE</h3>
<p>We do not share your information with companies, organizations, and individuals outside of Twinlife
    unless one of the following circumstances applies:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>with your consent;</li>
 	<li>through normal communication with notification servers operated by another entity (e.g. Google
        or Apple) to notify the application of an incoming call or message, when the application has
        been put to sleep by the device operating system;</li>
 	<li>through normal communication with a federated server operated by another entity. Some
        <strong><em>twinme</em></strong> users might be registered with other providers, which requires
        exchanging twincodes with these providers in order to communicate with their users;</li>
 	<li>when legally required.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will share the information we have with entities outside of Twinlife if we have a good faith
    belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is necessary to:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request;</li>
 	<li>enforce applicable <a href="terms_of_service.html">Terms of Service</a>, including
        investigation of potential violations;</li>
 	<li>detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues;</li>
 	<li>protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of Twinlife, our users, or the public
        as required or permitted by law.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will update this privacy policy as needed so that it is current, accurate, and as clear as possible.</p>
