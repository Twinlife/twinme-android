The User is responsible for finding information on costs resulting from the use of such equipment and/or services with the operators concerned. The User is alone liable for their costs.</p>

    <p>4 &#8211; Common operational factors.</p>

    <p>4.1 User obligations regarding his account.</p>

    <p>4.1.1 The use of the User’s electronic device and of the Application by the User is the sole User’s initiative and exclusively the User’s responsibility.</p>

    <p>4.1.2 The User is solely responsible for the use of his electronic device, as well as of his User Account.</p>

    <p>4.1.3 Any access, use of Services and data transmission from a User’s Application will be deemed as having been made by the latter. The protection and the confidentiality of the Application User Account entrusted to the User is indeed the full responsibility of the latter.</p>

    <p>4.1.4 Any loss, misuse or unauthorised use of the User Account, or of his mobile phone and the consequences are the sole responsibility of this User.</p>

    <p>4.2 Duration and Termination.</p>

SKRED can decide this termination and the resulting deletion of the User Account, without prejudice of any damages it may be entitled by reason of such breaches and all penalties due to it. The User thus acknowledges SKRED’s right to delete his User Account.</p>

    <p>4.2.5 SKRED may also, in case of breach of the hereby ToS, suspend the Service temporarily or permanently. In particular, SKRED may block the User to use some features of the Application.</p>

    <p>5- Services.</p>

    <p>SKRED is an internet communication service enabling Users to exchange text, voice or video messages through an internet connection.</p>

    <p>5.1 Services Commonalities</p>

    <p>5.1.1 Content is exchanged using the User’s electronic device, in particular using the User’s mobile phone or tablet. The User agrees not to reply to any unlawful statement and/or to report them (and in particular those contrary to the aspects described in point 6.3). SKRED does not guarantee the truthfulness, probity or honesty of exchanged Content, and cannot be held liable for any false declarations made by a User or any incorrect data and information. SKRED also disclaims any liability for any potential meeting organised between Users following the use of the Services.</p>

    <p>5.1.2 As part of the use of the Services, the User shall refrain from disclosing information allowing personal and precise identification of other Users, or any other natural or legal person, such as a surname, company name, postal and/or electronic address, or phone number. It is also recommended to the User not to disclose information on the Services, allowing his own personal and precise identification.</p>

    <p>5.1.3 The User is expressly informed that the Content is produced or exchanged under his sole responsibility. Therefore, only the owner of the electronic device linked to the User Account will assume the civil and criminal liability of the associated Content shown on his account. The User commits to ensure that the Content he exchanges does not contain any element which may be contrary to the laws and regulations in force, in the country from which he accesses the Service, in the country where these Contents are intended to be received, or likely to cause damage to a third party or breach any of the rules set forth in Article 6.3 below.</p>

    <p>5.1.4 The User declares to be the owner of all the associated Content shown on the Services, and that he hosts them without any restriction to property rights and other authorisations. Failing this, the User is deemed to have the authorisation from the holder of the rights of Content he would associate with his User Account. The User shall not register or transmit any Content that infringes intellectual property rights and/or the personality of other persons, including, but not limited to, work protected by copyright, trademarks, texts, images of persons or property, trade secrets, internal or confidential information.</p>

    <p>5.1.5 According to Article 323-1 of the Criminal Code (Ordinance no. 2000-916 of 19 September 2000, Article 3, Official Journal of 22 September 2000 in force 1 January 2002) which states, inter alia, that “Fraudulently accessing or remaining within all or part of an automated data processing system is punished by two years’ imprisonment and a fine of €30,000”, the User shall refrain from accessing the SKRED application again via another phone, tablet or any other technical means after being temporarily or permanently excluded from the Service.</p>

    <p>5.2 Description of Services.</p>

    <p>5.2.1 User Account</p>

    <p>After downloading the SKRED application, the User chooses a User Name. Said User Name can be changed freely by the User, without changing the User Account. The User Name chosen is not unique and can therefore be used by multiple Users simultaneously. Only the User Account is linked to the Electronic Device identifier, allowing the User access to the SKRED application. The User can choose not to activate his geolocation on his phone or tablet in the Device settings. He can also invite friends to use the application via his directory, social networks and any existing or future messaging system. He can, at any time, delete his User Account, by visiting the “settings” feature from the Application. His data will thus be erased within a period of one (01) year, in accordance with legal dispositions in force. Deleting a User Account will result in the immediate deletion of all SKRED publications and Content created by the said User, including the removal of his User Name or User Names.</p>

    <p>5.2.2 The User Text Messaging.</p>

    <p>The messaging system called “Conversations”, allows the User to talk privately with another User with which a Contact was previously established. The private dialogue or conversation is only visible by the Users who took part in the conversation. As a reminder, the Contact is established when two Users have added each other to their Contacts list. The conversation takes place only in the form of exchange of texts and files. A User has the ability to remove one or more messages in every conversation with another User, or to delete all of the conversation. Deleting works on a reciprocal basis. Thus, the other User, who took part in the conversation, will not retain the Content exchanged on his own device. The User can delete another User with who he is in Contact. The User having deleted the link between himself and the other User can no longer contact, nor be contacted by the latter.</p>

    <p>5.2.3 Voice/Video Messaging</p>

    <p>The messaging system called “Call” allow the User to initiate a voice or voice/video conversation with another User with which a Contact was previously established. As a reminder, the Contact is established when two Users have added each other to their Contact list. The conversation operates only as voice and/or video exchanges. The User having deleted the link between himself and the other User can no longer contact, nor be contacted by the latter.</p>

    <p>5.2.4 Website https://www.skred.mobi</p>

    <p>SKRED website is available for all Users with internet access and is located at the following address: https://www.skred.mobi</p>
